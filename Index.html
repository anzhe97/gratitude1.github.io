        <h1>What is positive psychology?</h1>
        <p>In the words of Martin Seligman, positive psychology is a science of positive subjective experience, positive
            individual traits, and positive institutions that promises to improve quality of life and prevent pathologies that arise
            when life is barren and meaningless. Fundamentally, positive psychology seeks to promote five key criterias that is
            believed to form the basis of well-being: positive emotion, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishments. This is
            known as PERMA, a theoretical model of happiness developed by Seligman to guide individuals towards a more enriching,
            fruitful existence.</p>

        <h1>What is gratitude?</h1>
        <p>Positive psychologists contend that gratitude is more than feeling thankful for something, but a deeper
            appreciation forsomeone (or something), that produces longer lasting positivity. Positive psychologists contend that gratitude is

        <h1>Our Gratitude Project</h1>
        <p>Gratitude is applied in our project by having people express their gratitude for things in their life that they
            might take for granted or forget about. Often, we forget about the value that someone or something has in our lives,
            and we forget to properly acknowledge or express gratitude toward that person or thing. This website displays
            stories that we have collected from family, friends, and colleagues about what they are grateful for and why. This website is
            meant to invoke the viewers to think of what they are grateful for in their lives. The website contains activities
            that promote gratitude and advice on how to express gratitude in your daily life, no matter what your situation or
            personality is,along with the proven positive outcomes that come with each activity.</p>
            <br>
        <p>Gratitude is an important part of positive psychology. Expressing gratitude, according to many studies, is
            associated with positive results like increased well-being, vitality, and happiness (Grateful to God or just plain grateful
            reading). Many therapies born out of positive psychology, like positive psychotherapy, contain gratitude-related
            exercises that improve an individual’s well-being. Gratitude is also giving acknowledgement toward someone for being in your life,
            which is one of the most impactful ways to increase your wellbeing and the wellbeing of others (The Virtual Gratitude Visit reading).</p>

            <br><br>
            <p>This picture was taken in April 2018. My grandma came to The U.S. to visit me for the first time. That was
                also the first time she came abroad and she stayed here for about a month. We have been to Hollywood, San Diego,
                Huntington Beach and so on. It was a joyful and memorable journey. I’m going to graduate this year in June. She was so glad
                that I invited her to see my graduation ceremony which is one of the most important time in my life. However, she
                had a really terrible stroke this April, and even lost the ability of talk and move. Yes, she is paralyzed from now on.
                This picture is precious to me is because that it will always reminds me that she has been such a great grandmother and
                how lovely she is. I will always love her.</p>

            <p>I took this picture when I was about to depart from Hong Kong, knowing that I was unable to get back to my
                hometown for at least three years. As my family was in the process of applying for the green card, I couldn’t leave the
                US since summer 2017. This very last photo I took in Asia epitomizes my lasting nostalgia and the mutual caring
                between me and my beloved ones. It’s so significant and precious to me because whenever I look at it, I feel as if it empowers
                me to trace back to my root. It’s so gentle and mild that it helps to wear off all the anxiety I’m going through in any
                current pain and challenge.</p>

            <p>Spending most of my life in the U.S., I didn’t have the chance to visit family members who were on the other side of the
            world. Over winter break of 2017, however, I had the chance to fly to New Zealand for vacation. Not only did I get to
            see a new country, but I also got to visit my uncle, who I haven’t seen in 11 years. This photo was taken on December
            31st, 2017. Being on the edge of all the time zones, we were the first in the entire world to welcome a new year. This
            photo makes me grateful because it captured the moment I got to experience a new year with my extended family for more
            than a decade. The photo reminds me of the family that I have on the other side of the world and that I will have many
            more chances in the future to experience cool moments with them.</p>

            <p>During my recitation in Science of Happiness on Friday, I was reminded of a person I am grateful for. She helped me and
            motivated me through my whole college experience. That person is my advisor. She was super helpful every semester and
            really pushed me to try my best in the classes I attended. During freshman year, I was not motivated and was adapting to
            a new environment in college. Eventually I was put in academic probation. In need of a change, I sought the help of my
            advisor. My advisor was patient with me and helped me through every step in college. I started gaining the motivation to
            try in class and soon I was passing all of my classes with ease. This picture reminds me of how much she helped me from
            freshman year till now, and it reminds me of how grateful I am to have such a kind and thoughtful advisor.</p>

            <p>As an incoming transfer student to UC Davis, I was nervous about fitting into a new environment. Transferring as a
            Junior student, I had to go back to square one in the middle of my college experience. While exploring the opportunities
            offered at Davis, I stumbled upon the “Orientation Leader” job with the Office of Admissions. I applied and received an
            invitation to be interviewed by the Orientation team the next week. Being a part of the Orientation team helped me meet
            other students and jumpstarted my college experience at Davis. I made great friends in the program and became much more
            acquainted with campus life. I am grateful for the Orientation team for making my transition into college smoother and
            getting me connected to student life on campus.</p>

            <p>This photo was taken on my Dad’s birthday in 2017. It’s a picture of my family and the gifts we got for my Dad on his
            birthday. On the morning of my Dad’s birthday, our entire family presented him gifts like books and cards and expressed
            our gratitude for everything he did for us. My dad is a really important figure in my life and has helped me through
            many hard times. He helped me through academic hardships in high school and gave me tons of life advice that I follow to
            this day. He has supported all my endeavours and I am very grateful for it. This photo reminds me of the gratitude that
            I have for my parents and all they have done for me.</p>
